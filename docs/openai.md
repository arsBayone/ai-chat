Benioff ditched ChatGPT for Gemini month after $100M OpenAI deal. Three years ago Google panicked over ChatGPT now reversed. Losing billions $157B valuation assumes they're leader. Gemini 650M users ChatGPT 800M gap closing. Ilya said age of scaling over. Yann LeCun agrees. Bleeding top people. $1.4T commitments need growth. Existential not just competitive.
